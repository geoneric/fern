Introduction
============
Currently the agent-based modelling and field-based modelling are two seperate worlds. Although in some agent-base modelling environments it is possible to use information from rasters, and although in field based modelling agents are sometimes represented by raster cells, conceptually these modelling worlds have very little in common. There is a lack of common concepts that merge the agent-based and field-based data models and modelling concepts. Without these, hacks will always be required to use functionality of the other in either model types.

Information about the uncertainty in attribute values is hardly ever stored along with the attribute's values. There is a lack of data set formats to store uncertain spatio-temporal attribute values. Without such a format, hacks will always be needed to encorporate uncertainty information in a modelling study.

This document describes concepts that are common to agent-based and field-based modelling with uncertain spatio-temporal feature attributes. Using these concepts, a modelling environment consisting of a data set format, modelling operations and modelling techniques, like Monte Carlo analysis and data assimilation can be designed.
