Introduction
============
Currently the agent-based modelling and field-based modelling are two seperate worlds. Although in some agent-base modelling environments it is possible to use information from rasters, and although in field based modelling agents are sometimes represented by raster cells, conceptually these modelling worlds have very little in common. There is a lack of concepts that merge the agent-based and field-based data models and modelling concepts.

Information about the temporal domain and the uncertainty in attribute values is hardly ever stored along with the attribute's values. There is a lack of data set formats to store uncertain spatio-temporal attribute values.

This document describes concepts that are common to agent-based and field-based modelling with uncertain spatio-temporal feature attributes. The ultimate goal is to be able to develop a modelling environment for uncertain attributes of spatio-temporal phenomena.
