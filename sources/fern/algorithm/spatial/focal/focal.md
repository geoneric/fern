Theory {#focal_spatial_algorithms_theory}
======
Geospatial Analysis:

Gradient refers to a vector quantity: an object that has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude or size of the gradient is the slope, whilst the direction in which the maximum value of this magnitude occurs is known as the aspect.
