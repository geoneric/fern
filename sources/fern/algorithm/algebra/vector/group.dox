    Theory
    ======
    The *directed line segment* from point \f$P\f$ to \f$Q\f$, denoted
    by \f$\overrightarrow{PQ}\f$, is the straight-line segment that
    extents from \f$P\f$ to \f$Q\f$. \f$\overrightarrow{PQ}\f$ and
    \f$\overleftarrow{QP}\f$ are different since they point in opposite
    directions.

    Point \f$P\f$ is called the *initial point* of the segment and point
    \f$Q\f$ is called the *terminal point*. Two important properties
    of a directed line segment are its magnitude (length) and its
    direction. If two directed line segments \f$\overrightarrow{PQ}\f$
    and \f$\overrightarrow{RS}\f$ have the same magnitude and direction,
    they are said to be *equivalent*, no matter where they are located
    with respect to the origin.

    The set of all directed line segments equivalent to a given directed
    line segment is called a *vector*.

    A *vector* \f$\mathbf{v}\f$ in the xy-plane is an ordered pair of
    real numbers \f$(a, b)\f$. The number \f$a\f$ and \f$b\f$ are called
    the *components* of the vector \f$\mathbf{v}\f$. The *zero vector*
    is the vector \f$(0, 0)\f$ and is denoted by \f$\mathbf{0}\f$. Two
    vectors are equal if their corresponding components are equal. That
    is, \f$(a, b) == (c, d)\f$ if \f$a == c\f$ and \f$b == d\f$.

    \f$|\mathbf{v}| = \f$ magnitude of \f$\mathbf{v} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\f$.

    The *direction* of the vector \f$\mathbf{v} = (a, b)\f$ is the angle
    \f$\theta\f$, measured in radians, that the vector makes with the
    positive x-axis. By convention \f$0 \le \theta < 2\pi\f$.

    If \f$a \ne 0\f$, then \f$tan \theta = \frac{b}{a}\f$

    http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/log.htm :

    The Laplacian is a 2-D isotropic measure of the 2nd spatial derivative
    of an image. The Laplacian of an image highlights regions of rapid
    intensity change and is therefore often used for edge detection.

    Santiago:

    The laplacian operator is the second-order derivative of a scalar
    field, and it measures the divergence of the gradient of the scalar
    field (what is commonly known as the curvature in GIS analysis). It
    maps a scalar field to a scalar field, and is a combination of the
    divergence and the gradient operators.

    Wikipedia:

    The laplacian of a function \f$f\f$ is defined by:

    \f[
        \Delta f = \nabla^2f = \nabla \cdot \nabla f
    \f]

    The laplace operator in two dimensions is given by:

    \f[
        \Delta f = \frac{\delta^2 f}{\delta x^2} + \frac{\delta^2 f}{\delta y^2}
    \f]

    where x and y are the Cartesian coordinates.
