Fern {#mainpage}
====

Welcome to the Fern API documentation! Fern is a growing collection of software targetted at software developers and environmental modellers. Software developers can jump-start their projects by using Fern for the high performance calculations. Modellers can use Fern to build their models, without having to know about the details of programming a computer for high performance computing.

Although the scope of the envisioned Fern software is very broad, we had to start somewhere. We started with implementing a set of generic algorithms for manipulating gridded data (1D, 2D and 3D). For an overview of these Fern.Algorithm algorithms, visit the @ref fern_algorithm_group group page.
