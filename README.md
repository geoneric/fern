Building blocks for scalable high-performance geocomputing

This project is very much work in progress. We have not created a release
yet. Nevertheless, Fern is currently being used in the folowing projects:

- openLISEM (http://blogs.itc.nl/lisem): A spatial model for runoff, floods
  and erosion
- PCRaster (http://www.pcraster.eu): Software for environmental modelling

If you are also a Fern user, then please let us know (info@geoneric.eu),
and we will add you to the list!
