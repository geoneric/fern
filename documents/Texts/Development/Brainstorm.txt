Goal
++++

New generation of software for creation of simulation models handling spatio-temporal data. This software make use of more generic concepts and has more capabilities useful in environmental modelling.

More generic
------------

Focus is on generic data items, each of which describes the variability of a single attribute's values. These data items can be single values (no variability), spatials (variability in space), temporals (variability in time), and have uncertainty associated with it. The assumption is that, in general, the majority of data items are spatio-temporal, and have uncertainty associated with them.
In modelling, a regular discretization is benefitial for the sake of runtime and ease of implementation of operations. Majority of data sets used will have regular discretization (grids, time steps).

New features
------------

Nested data
~~~~~~~~~~~

New kind of data: raster with capability of nesting data sets in each cell. For example, each cell in a raster may contain some spatial attribute value (another raster), describing a phenomenon which has different spatial characteristics for each location in space.

New dimensions
--------------

The general pattern in creating a modelling environment is:

  #. Abstract data (eg: treat single values and spatials the same).
  #. Provide operations on the abstracted data types.

The goal is to find reasons of attribute value variation, abstracting it and providing useful operations. Map algebra is a modelling environment in which spatial data is handled in a similar fasion as single values.

Given that the majority of attribute values vary in space and time, it is obvious that time should also be abstracted and usefull functions for temporal analysis should be provided. The same holds for uncertainty associated with attribute's values.

The majority of modelling environments do not treat space, time and uncertainty in an integrated fasion.

Additionally, modellers typically make use of alternative ways to model the same phenomenon, for example by using different model implementations or by using different input data sets (this includes parameter values used in the model). There is a whole set of useful operations that have been developed to handle alternative outcomes of a phenomenon's values. Currently this functionality is not part of modelling environments.

Although much functionality



Example
+++++++

Example to show benefits of abstracting data and providing high level operations handling these.

Algebra
=======
Given the inputs are single values, it is obvious what the meaning is of the folowing statement.

::

  a = b + c

Map algebra
===========

Map algebra provides us with the capabilities to use spatial data in a similar fasion as single values. Instead of calculating a single value as output, all spatial locations (coordinates) in the spatial input are visited, and the operation is applied to each of the data values at these locations.




Given b and c represent single values, spatial values, temporal values, uncertain values and alternative values.
