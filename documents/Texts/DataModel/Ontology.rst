Model ontology
==============
This section uses the term *attribute* to mean the collection of values that describe a certain (environmental) phenomenon, like height, soil class, speed, gravity, distance to a road. All values used in environmental modelling are attribute values. Some of these values are model inputs, some are model outputs, and some are both model inputs and outputs.

A feature is a combination of a spatio-temporal domain with one or more attributes. A feature's domain defines the locations in space and time for the feature's attribute values. All attribute values are coupled to some feature. Think of a feature as some defined area in space and time, for example, a country in the period 2000 untill 2050, or a gauging station at October 4, 2012 at 13:00.

There is always a correspondence between an attribute and some real-world phenomenon. Empirical values are also treated as attributes. Empirical values are tied to the feature earth, or space in general, for example.

Modellers are interested in attributes and there location in space and time, not technicalities. Modellers model concentrations, income, volumes, speeds, directions, etc. The fact that there are things like agents, points, rasters, vectors, single precision floating points, unsigned integers, etc, is an implementation detail that may or may not be relevant to the modeller. It may not matter to him as long as requirements in execution speed, data size, accuracy, etc are met. Since environmental attributes matter more to humans than implementation details, working with attributes results in a simpler, more correct, design for a modelling environment, than working with concepts like rasters, features, time steps, and Monte Carlo sample numbers.

In the next section, we describe ways to categorize attributes. This will improve our understanding of what attributes are. After that, we move on to the functions that are used to manipulate attributes in a model. Finally, we have something to say about the modelling environment.

[Attributes vs parameters vs inputs vs outputs]

Attribute type categorizations
------------------------------
The categorizations mentioned below divide the attribute types in various partitions. By combining the categories, it must be possible to define all attribute types that are elevant in environmental modelling. If not, then we are missing a discriminating factor.

This section does not mention implementation details like raster and vector because these notions are only relevant in software. In the end these concepts matter and the modeller may have to know about them, but they are not relevant for describing the attribute type categorizations.

This section does not deal with uncertainty, whether or not attributes are spatial, and whether or not attributes are temporal. The rule is:

.. important::

   All attributes are uncertain spatio-temporal attributes.

The fact that information about the spatio-temporal variation of an attribute's values is missing means that the attribute's values don't vary in space and/or time. Unmeasured values (unavailable, no-data values) are explicitly marked as such.

In case information about the uncertainty in an attribute's values is missing, this most probably means the information is not available. In this case, for practical reasons, one must assume that the attribute's values are completely known.

Given that, we can conclude that the constant value 5 is an example of an uncertain spatio-temporal attribute value. The value is 5 at all locations in the spatio-temporal domain and the error in the attribute value is zero at all these locations. Reasons why an attribute's value is constant in space and/or time are, for example:

* The spatio-temporal domain is small compared to the variability of the attribute.
* The measuring technique is not sensitive enough to pick up variation in the attribute's values.
* Given the modelling task at hand, the model result is not sensitive enough to the attribute's variation.

The fact that an attribute's value is constant or varies through space and/or time is not an inherit characteristic of the feature. Therefore:

.. important::

   There is no distinction between model inputs and model parameters.

In fact, this was the last time we used the word parameter.

Constant attribute values can be replaced by varying atttribute values and vice versa, at any time. Not storing constant values for every location in space and time is an optimization. The modeller can assume there are attribute values at every location in space and time.

Continuous versus discrete variation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When we consider the type of variation of attribute values, we can categorize the attributes in continuous and discrete types.

Spatially continous
"""""""""""""""""""
* These attributes are defined along at least one spatial dimension. Along each of these dimensions, the attribute is either missing or known. In principle, the attribute could be known at all locations.
* 1D: height along a profile, land-use along a profile
* 2D: height, land-use (by x, y), wind direction
* 3D: air pressure, wind direction

Spatially discrete
""""""""""""""""""
* These attributes are tied to entities that have a finite extent in space.
* Points: concentration (by gauging station)
* Lines: length of traffic jam (by road segment), sediment concentration (by river segment), intensity of use (by railway segment)
* Polygons: average income (by municipality), land-use (by parcel)

Temporal continuous
"""""""""""""""""""
* These attributes are defined along the time dimension. The attribute is either missing or known. In principle, the attribute could be known at all moments in time.
* Temperature

Temporal discrete
"""""""""""""""""
* Temporal discrete attribute. These attributes are tied to periods that have a finite extent in time.
* Speed and direction during mass movement

And now to something completely different...
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Given the current generation of GIS and environmental modelling software, it seems that there are two different kinds of discretisized attributes: those with spatio-temporally discretely varying values (features), and those with spatio-temporally continuously varying values (rasters). But even a spatio-temporally continuously varying attribute is always tied to a discrete entity. A sattelite image, for example, contains spatially continuously varying attribute values, but those values are linked to the area for which these values are defined. In the example of a sattelite image this is the border of the image. In other cases this area may be a research area, a country, a continent, the earth, a set of planets, all planets, etc.

So, when all attribute values are eventually linked to a descrete entity (which we call a feature-item later on), then the thing that is different between the continuously and discretely varying attribute values is the fact that a discretely varying attribute has a single value per feature-item, and a continuously varying attribute has a collection of values (vector, 2D matrix, 3D matrix) per feature-item. In the example of the mass movement event in the previous section, it would be nice to be able to store the start and the end moment of the movement, and be able to continuously record the speed and direction attributes during the event. Likewise, in the case of the sattelite images, the feature's geometry store—ï the location of the image, but the attribute's continuously varying values are stored using a 2D matrix. More about this in the Data Model section.

Mobile versus stationary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Another way to look at attributes is from the standpoint of mobility. Obviously, some attributes travel through space in time and others don't. (We will consider temporal mobility once that becomes an option in real-life.)

Spatial mobile
""""""""""""""
* These attributes (potentially) change their spatial location.
* attribute by river, attribute by road, attribute by individual

Spatial stationary
""""""""""""""""""
* These attributes don't change spatial location.
* attribute by house, attribute by road segment, attribute by railway segment

Spatial mobility depends on the time scale. Spatial object which are stationary on short time scales, may be mobile on larger time scales.

Generalizing:

.. important::

   All attributes are spatially mobile.

But some of them just don't move within the modelled time period.

Functions
---------
Attributes versus functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An attribute contains values that represent the state of the attribute. Functions calculate attribute values, based on the state of one or more other attributes. In a way, functions are very much like attributes. They just need to perform some calculation before being able to provide the new attribute's state values. Or, the other way around, reading existing attribute values is like executing some identity function that simply returns the attribute's current state values, unchanged.

.. important::

   Attributes are very similar to functions. Both are attribute value providers.

Functions versus models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A function accepts input attributes and calculates the state values of output attributes. Models (including user defined functions) do the same thing. The difference between the two is a matter of scale / hierarchy. Whether or not a function or a model uses iteration to calculate the result is of no relevance and can be considered an internal detail.

.. important::

   Functions are very similar to models. Both are attribute value providers.

Combining the rules above:

.. important::

   Attributes, functions and models are all attribute providers. They differ wrt the amount of effort that needs to be done to generate the output attribute's state values. Apart from that, the difference is one of scale/complexity/hierarchy.

A built-in function like slope is, in principal, no different from a user-defined function. Built-in functions have a more generic nature. Entire models can be seen as functions too. In fact, in some programming languages (`C`, `C++`, ...), the implementation of an executable must always contain the top-level function called `main`.

.. important::

   All statements in a model are eventually part of a function. Apart from built-in functions, all functions execute other functions.

[Rename function to operation]

Modelling environment
---------------------
All attributes are passive, in the sense that they are just values and there is no behavioural logic coupled to the attribute that is able to change the attribute values. All attributes are input to operations that return newly calculated attribute values. This is common usage in map algebra implementations, but agent based models tend to use an object oriented type of approach that couples behaviour with attribute values. The same functionality can be achieved by defining functions that recieve attributes that are coupled to spatially discrete objects, for example. This results in a general algebraic modelling language where operations accept all kinds of attributes, creating new attributes.
