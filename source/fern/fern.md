Fern {#mainpage}
====
Welcome to the Fern API documentation! Fern is a growing collection
of software targetted at software developers and environmental
modellers. Software developers can jump-start their projects by using Fern
for the high performance calculations. Modellers can use Fern to build
their models, without having to know about the details of programming
a computer for high performance computing.

The scope of the envisioned Fern software is broad, but we started with
implementing an initial set of generic algorithms for manipulating gridded
data (1D, 2D and 3D). For an overview of these algorithms, visit the
@ref fern_algorithm_group group page.
