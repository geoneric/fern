Fern {#mainpage}
====
Welcome to the Fern API documentation! Fern is a growing collection
of software targetted at software developers and modellers. Software
developers can jump-start their projects by using Fern for the
high-performance calculations. Modellers can use Fern to build their
models, without having to know about the details of programming a computer
for high-performance computing.

The Fern source code and documentation is grouped in modules. For an
overview of these modules, see the [modules](modules.html) page.
